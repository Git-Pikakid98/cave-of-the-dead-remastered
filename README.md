# Cave Of The Dead: Remastered

`Source code disclaimer: This was decompiled via a third party UndertaleModTool script and is NOT guaranteed to be fully functional. If you get script errors or warnings of missing files, there's nothing I can do about that`

An abandoned remaster of my first ever game. Ported from Game Maker 8.1 to Game Maker Studio v1.4. My original idea was to fully rework this game with all new graphics and music while including the original untouched version. An addiional idea was to extend the game and make an entire sequel on top of the remaster. But this much like the actual sequel was abandoned
